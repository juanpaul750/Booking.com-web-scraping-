Hotel Data Web Scraping using Playwright 

# Winter Hotel Price Analysis in the US

This project involves web scraping data from Booking.com to analyze and rank US states by hotel prices during the winter season (1st December to 31st December 2024). The objective is to determine which states offer the cheapest winter hotels.

## Project Overview

Using Booking.com, I undertook a comprehensive web scraping project to gather hotel price data for the winter season, specifically from 1st December to 31st December 2024. The objective was to determine and rank which US states have the cheapest winter hotels.

## Web Scraping Process

I used Playwright for automated browsing and data extraction from Booking.com. The script was designed to search for hotels in each US state and gather details including:
- Hotel name
- Price
- Average review rating
- Number of reviews
- Address

### Steps Involved:
1. **Launching Browser:** Automated the launch of a browser using Playwright.
2. **Navigating to Search Results:** For each US state, the script navigated to the search results page on Booking.com.
3. **Extracting Data:** Retrieved relevant information from HTML elements on the page.
4. **Data Collection:** Successfully collected information for 1,078 hotels across all US states.
